h1. Making things prettier

This lesson we are going to start making our content a bit prettier.  We do that using a language called CSS - which stands for Cascading Style Sheet.

h2. Colours

h4. Demonstration

In jsfiddle enter the following:
* HTML: @<h1>My heading</h1><p>Here is some body text blah blah.</p>@
* CSS: @h1 {color: red; background-color: yellow} p {color: green;}@

h4. Practical
* Do the demonstration yourself.  Note that the American spelling of colour is used - *color*.
* Play with the colours a bit.  The 17 standard colours are aqua, black, blue, fuchsia, gray, grey, green, lime, maroon, navy, olive, purple, red, silver, teal, white, and yellow.  A complete list, with samples, can be found at "www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colornames.asp":http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colornames.asp.
* Play with the normalize css checkbox.  Think about what is happening.

Colours can be expressed in other ways, such as three numbers between 0 and 255, representing how much Red, Green and Blue there is in the colour.  For example @color: rgb(242,150,9)@ is a kind of orangey brown.  You will also see @color: #f29609@ which is the same three numbers expressed in base 16, one after the other.  The "ColorPicker.com":www.colorpicker.com site is a good place to learn about colours and which colours work well together.

h2. The syntax of CSS

A CSS stylesheet is made up of one or more *rules*.
Each rule contains a *selector* (@p@ for example) which tells the browsers which bit of content to apply the style to, and a *declaration group* which specifies the style to be applied.
A declaration group sits in curly brackets or braces @{}@ and consists of one or more *declarations* such as @color:green;@.
A declaration is formed of a *property* (such as @color@), a colon @:@, a *value* (such as @green@) and a semi-colon @;@.

h2. Where can we put CSS?

h4. Demonstration

* In jsfiddle make sure Normalized CSS is enabled
* Using the browser _Inspect Element_ or equivalent, find the iframe where jsfiddle constructs the page.
* Point out external style sheet
* Point out internal style sheet

h4. Practical

* Repeat the demonstration and locate the two types of CSS in the iframe
* Uncheck the normalized css and refresh.  Where is the @<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/css/normalize.css">@ gone?

h4. The three places we can put our CSS
# In an external style sheet, which we link to from the head section of our HTML.  For example @<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/css/normalize.css">@  this is the preferred method.
# In an internal style sheet in the head of our HTML.  For example @<style type="text/css">h1 {color: red; background-color: yellow} p {color: green;}</style>@
# Inline styling, such as @<p style="color:green;">blah blah</p>@.  This mixes presentation with content, and should be avoided except while experimenting.

h4. Discussion

Why is an external stylesheet the best place to put your CSS?  
* Sharing between pages
* Separation of concerns no mixing presentation with content
* Another skill set - can be worked on by someone else

In fact there is a fourth place where CSS is specified - by the browser.  Each browser has default styles built in.  This is what we see if we clear the Normalized CSS checkbox in "jsfiddle":jsfiddle.net and clear out the CSS section.

h4. Practical

* Move your CSS into a .CSS file in your document folder
* Move your HTML to a .HTML file in the same folder
* Create a link to the CSS file in the HTML file (an external file sheet)
* Open the HTML file in the browser
