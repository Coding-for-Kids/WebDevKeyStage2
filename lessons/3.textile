h1. Making things prettier

This lesson we are going to start making our content a bit prettier.  We do that using a language called CSS - which stands for Cascading Style Sheet.

h4. Demonstration

* In jsfiddle @<h1>My heading</h1><p>Here is some body text blah blah.</p>@
* @h1 { color: red; background-color: yellow} p {color: green;}@

h4. Practical
* Do the demonstrations yourself
* Play with the colours a bit 
* Play with the nomalize css.  Think about what is happening.

A CSS stylesheet is made up of one or more *rules*.
Each rule contains a *selector* (@p@ for example) which tells the browsers which bit of content to apply the style to, and a *declaration group* which specifies the style to be applied.
A declaration group sits in curly brackets or braces @{}@ and consists of one or more *declarations* such as @color:green;@.
A declaration is formed of a *property* (such as @color@), a colon @:@, a *value* (such as @green@) and a semi-colon @;@.

h2. Where can we put CSS?

h4. Demonstration

* In jsfiddle make sure Normalized CSS is enabled
* Using the browser _Inspect Element_ or equivalent, find the iframe where jsfiddle constructs the page.
* Point out external style sheet
* Point out internal style sheet

h4. Practical

* Repeat the demonstration and locate the two types of CSS in the iframe
* Uncheck the normalized css and refresh.  Where is the @<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/css/normalize.css">@ gone?

h4. The three places we can put our CSS
# In an external style sheet, which we link to from the head section of our HTML.  For example @<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/css/normalize.css">@  this is the preferred method.
# In an internal style sheet in the head of our HTML.  For example @<style type="text/css">h1 {color: red; background-color: yellow} p {color: green;}</style>@
# Inline styling, such as @<p style="color:green;">blah blah</p>@.  This mixes presentation with content, and should be avoided except while experimenting.

h4. Discussion

Why is an external stylesheet the best place to put your CSS?  
* Sharing between pages
* Separation of concerns no mixing presentation with content
* Another skill set - can be worked on by someone else
