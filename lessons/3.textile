h1. Making things prettier

h4. Demonstration

* In jsfiddle @<h1>My heading</h1><p>Here is some body text blah blah.</p>@
* @h1 { color: red; background-color: yellow} p {color: green;}@

h4. Practical
* Do the demonstrations yourself
* Play with the colours a bit 
* Play with the nomalize css.  Think about what is happening.

rules, selectors, declaration groups, declarations

h2. Where can we put CSS?

h4. Demonstration

* In jsfiddle make sure Normalized CSS is enabled
* Using the browser _Inspect Element_ or equivalent, find the iframe where jsfiddle constructs the page.
* Point out external style sheet
* Point out internal style sheet

h4. Practical

* Repeat the demonstration and locate the two types of CSS in the iframe
* Uncheck the normalized css and refresh.  Where is the @<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/css/normalize.css">@ gone?

h4. The three places we can put our CSS
# In an external style sheet, which we link to from the head section of our HTML.  For example @<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/css/normalize.css">@  this is the preferred method.
# In an internal style sheet in the head of our HTML.  For example @<style type="text/css">h1 {color: red; background-color: yellow} p {color: green;}</style>@

h4. Discussion
Why is an external stylesheet the best place to put your CSS?  
* Sharing between pages
* Separation of concerns no mixing presentation with content
* Another skill set - can be worked on by someone else
