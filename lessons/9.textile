h2. Tables 

In the last HTML we saw that we can use a list (ordered or unordered) for our wish-list project.  Tables are used to list things that have the same properties.  In our case we could have a table that had a column with an image of the present, a column describing why we wanted it and a column with the approximate price.

Tables use the @<table>@ element.  Every row needs a table row element - @<tr>@, and every *cell* within the row needs a table data element @<td>@.  It is very common to use a border attribute with your table element such as @border="1"@.

There is a lot that you can do with tables such as have cells spanning columns, headings etc (see the relevant section of "W3Schools":http://www.w3schools.com/html for more detail) but one thing you should never do is use tables to lay out html content that is not a list of similar data elements - that is the job of CSS.
<pre>
<code><table border="1">
    <tr>
      <td>row 1, cell 1</td>
      <td>row 1, cell 2</td></tr>
    <tr>
      <td>row 2, cell 1</td>
      <td>row 2, cell 2</td></tr></table>
</code></pre>

h4. Practical

* Create a 2 column, 3 row table using the presents from the previous section, with the second column being an approximate price.
* See what the table looks like without borders, and with different border values.
* If you have time, find out at "W3Schools":http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp how to add a header to your table and do so.
