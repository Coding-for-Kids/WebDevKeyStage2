h1. Structure and Content

h2. Our first HTML file

h4. Demonstration:

* Open notepad
* Write hello world with no tags
* Save as hello.html
* Open in Chrome
* Right click and Inspect Element

h4. Lessons:

* (Some) browsers are forgiving
* Structure of well formed HTML document - HTML, Head, Body

h4. Practical:

* Do it yourself
* If you finish quickly - add some more content and have a play at adding some of the tags we saw last week, h1, title 

h2. Experimenting with jsfiddle.net

If we use the website jsfiddle.net then we get two big advantages: 
* We get to see what we are working on at the same time as the HTML
* We get syntax highlighting

h4. Demonstration:

* Type in a heading and some body
* Do Ctrl-Enter - notice that there are no default styles
* Untick the "Normalised CSS" checkbox and do Ctrl-Enter

h4. Practical

* Repeat the demonstration, and have a play in jsfiddle

h2. Some common elements

@<title>@ - the browser title, remember, not something that appears in the body.  Head elements cannot be used in jsfiddle.net.
@<h1>@...@<h6>@ - headings.  1 is the biggest, 6 the smallest

h2. Presentational elements (old and bad!) and semantic equivalents (new and good)

@<br>@ (use @<p>@ instead).  Here the old element doesn't add meaning to the content - it adds meaning to the empty gaps between content, which is nonsense.
@<b>@ and @<i>@ should not be used for presentation (as we will be using CSS for that - starting next week).  Elements should be about meaning, not presentation.  Presentation can then be decided depending on the medium - a reader for blind people for instance, cannot read in bold, but can add stress to words.

Related semantic markup elements from HTML5:
* @<i>@ text in an “alternate voice,” such as foreign words, technical terms and typographically italicized text 
* @<b>@ “stylistically offset” text, such as keywords and typographically emboldened text
* @<em>@  for stress emphasis, i.e., something you’d pronounce differently
* @<strong>@  for strong importance

Another new element is @<mark>@ which marks the text, like you were highlighting it.

h2. Some new elements (and their old equivalents)

@<article>@ (used to be @<div>@) - a passage of text (and perhaps other content) that makes sense on its own
@<section>@ (used to be @<div>@) - a passage of text belongs with another section to make complete sense
@<header>@ (used to be @<div>@) - a the top section
@<footer>@ (used to be @<div>@) - a bottom section

h2. class and id attributes

Two very important attributes that we need to use next week are *id* and *class*.  They are typically added to @<section>@ and @<p>@ elements so that we can apply different styles to different sections.

h4. Practical 

Look at the source of a favourite web site and see if you can find any @<section>@ elements with *class* or *id* attributes (use Ctrl-F).  No?  Now look for @<div>@.  Most websites are still using HTML4.

h2. Preview of next HTML lesson (in 3 weeks)

To display a picture on your page you use an @<img>@ element.  This is a singleton element - it has no closing tag (the slash appears at the end of the only tag).  All the information is contained in _attributes_ in the first tag.  For example:
@<img src="http://www.placekitten.com/200/300" />@
*src* is short for _source_ - where the picture comes from.
