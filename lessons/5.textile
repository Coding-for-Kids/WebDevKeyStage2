As this is the last lesson of the term we are going to deviate from the plan and do revision:

YRS2012 - 1st week of August
HTML revision.  title, h1..h6, p, i, b, em, strong, mark, article, section, header, footer, img
CSS Revision. color, background-color, inline, internal and external style sheets
Javascript Revision. var, document.write(), console.log(), alert(), confirm(), operators, for loops, if [else if] [else]

Practical (using notepad - the network is too slow to use jsfiddle.net)
1.  Hackers: Using Javascript create a page on the fly that lists out the times tables from 1 to 12.
2.  Designers: Design a Christmas greeting web page using HTML and CSS (in an external syle sheet if you can).  You can use <marquee> if you like.
