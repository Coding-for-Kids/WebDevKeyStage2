h2. Inheriting, Merging and Cascading

A browser builds up the property values for a selector as follows:

* Start with the browser built-in styling for the selector.  If it is not defined for the selector then start with the styling for the selector that this selector inherits from (body is the lowest level).
* Process the style sheets in the order in which they appear in the head.  If a new declaration matches your selector, merge it in.  If it clashes with an existing declaration, override the old one (cascading).
* Process the inline style in the same manner.

h4. Practical

* In your external stylesheet set the background-color to black for the p selector
* Create an internal stylesheet that sets color to white for the p selector.  Refresh the browser - you should see white text on a black background, as the properties have been merged.
* In your HTML file set up an inline style for a p element that sets the color to yellow.  Refresh the browser - you should see yellow text on a black background, as it has 'cascaded' on to of the white.
* In your HTML file modify your inline style so that is says <p style="color:yellow; color:aqua">.  Refresh the browser - you should see aqua text on a black background, as the aqua was the last value to be read, and it has 'cascaded' on top of the yellow.

h2. Backgrounds - styling with pictures

Last week we learnt about the HTML @<img>@ tag, which can be used to put a picture on the screen.  Remember though that we want our HTML documents only to contain content, not style, so if we want a picture _just_ for prettiness, then we don't want it in our HTML.  We _would_ use the @<img>@ tag if the picture was part of the content of the document, such as a picture of a present on your wish list in the project, but if we just wanted a fancy background for our page we would use the @background-image@ paoperty.

h4. Practical

* Add the line @body { background-image : url(http://goo.gl/WqRGY) ; }@ to your stylesheet and refresh the browser
* Add the declaration @background-repeat : no-repeat@ and refresh again.  Notice that the actual picture is very small and the browser "tiles" it by default.

h2. Class and ID

Last week we looked at adding these attributes could be used with an HTML tag - now we will see how we can make use of this.  You create a CSS selector for a class by prefixing the class name with a dot (.) which you will often see called 'period' in documentation as that is how americans say it.  You create a selector for an ID by prefixing the ID name with a hash (#) which the americans sometimes call a pound sign (I have no idea why).

h4. Practical

* Add two more paragraphs to your document, one with class "bold" and one with id "italic" 
* Add some CSS to make the paragraph with the bold class appear bold
* Add some CSS to make the paragraph with the id italic appear (yes, you guessed it) italic

h2. Link States

Have you noticed how links sometimes change their appearance when you put your mouse over them or when you have visited them?  You can do this with the pseudo classes 
* :link - an unvisited link
* :visited - a visited link
* :hover - an element when you mouse over it
* :active - an element in clicked state
If you specify styles for more than one they must be in that order).

h4. Practical

Add a link to your favoutite website and style the link so that it appears with an orange background when it has been visited 

h2. So how powerful is CSS?

There is a famous site on the internet called "www.csszengarden.com":http://www.csszengarden.com/ which contains an HTML file that is displayed with many different CSS files.  Have a look at some examples, examine the CSS and see what properties you recognise.
